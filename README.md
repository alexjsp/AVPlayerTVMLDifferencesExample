# AVPlayerTVMLDifferencesExample

This project demonstrates some weird differences between AVPlayer and the TVML Player when playing a HLS stream.

Note that when playing the stream via AVPlayer index files are generated and shown when scrubbing, but fast forward and rewind by placing your finger on the right / left edge of the touch pad and then clicking and holding does not work.

Note that when using TVML player no index files are generated, but fast forward and rewind do work.
